            <h1>Our Objective</h1>
            <p>Turtle Hatcheries in Sri Lanka are conservation centers of utmost importance focused on protecting endangered sea turtles. These hatcheries provide a safe haven for housing turtles and ensuring the survival of their eggs. Hatcheries relocate and safeguard these eggs for protection from threats and predators.<br>Baby turtles are released unto the ocean after hatching and completion of nurturing by these hatcheries. They also inspire visitors from around the island and all over the world by raising awareness about sea turtle conservation and receive contributions too to carry out their crucial role in shielding these majestic beings and promote the sustainbaility of the marine ecosystem.</p>

        <p class="image-description">A key conservation facility is the Hikkaduwa Turtle Hatchery, which is situated in Sri Lanka. By rescuing and treating injured people and raising awareness, it safeguards sea turtles. Eggs are gathered and protected at the hatchery, and young are then released into the ocean. The hatchery works to protect these amazing animals and their habitats for future generations via education and sustainable practices.

        <p class="image-description">The green turtle, or Chelonia mydas as it is named scientifically, is a fascinating marine reptile that may be found in tropical and subtropical oceans all over the world. This critically endangered species, renowned for its herbivorous diet and striking green-colored fat, is essential to preserving seagrass environments. To safeguard their nesting beaches, lessen risks like habitat loss and pollution, and guarantee the survival of these exquisite creatures for future generations, conservation activities are essential. </p>

        <img src="climatefrontpage.jpg" alt="climate change">
        <p class="image-description">For turtles, climate change presents substantial difficulties. Unbalanced sex ratios result from rising temperatures' impact on nest incubation. Foraging habitats are disrupted and nesting beaches are eroded by sea level rise. Migration patterns are impacted by changes in ocean currents. Extreme weather conditions pose a threat to nests and young. The existence and well-being of turtles and their delicate habitats depend on mitigating the effects of climate change.</p>
